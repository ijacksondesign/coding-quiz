## Reflection <a name="reflection"></a>
This looked so simple, but it was the most time consuming and hardest project so far. JavaScript is showing itself to be the hardest of the core web design languages, but I can see why it's so important. It took a lot of referencing the module lessons, class assignments, and Google to complete this assignment and even then it's not as good as it could be.

It hits all the criteria requirements, but there's some bugs that I'm not quite sure how to work out. That being said though, I am extremely proud of this, bugs and all, just because it was such a challenge. It really forced me to think and got my brain firing. I like to think I have a better understanding of JS after this, but I think only time will tell whether it sticks or not.
